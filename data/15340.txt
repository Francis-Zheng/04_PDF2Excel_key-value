 Disclosure Event Details
 What you should know about reported disclosure events:

     1. BrokerCheck provides details for any disclosure event that was reported in CRD. It also includes
        summary information regarding FINRA arbitration awards in cases where the brokerage firm was
        named as a respondent.
     2. Certain thresholds must be met before an event is reported to CRD, for example:
             o  A law enforcement agency must file formal charges before a brokerage firm  is required to disclose a
                particular criminal event.
     3. Disclosure events in BrokerCheck reports come from different sources:
             o  Disclosure events for this brokerage firm were reported by the firm and/or regulators. When the firm
                and a regulator report information for the same event, both versions of the event will appear in the
                BrokerCheck report. The different versions will be separated by a solid line with the reporting source
                labeled.
     4. There are different statuses and dispositions for disclosure events:
             o  A disclosure event may have a status of pending, on appeal, or final.
                   §   A "pending" event involves allegations that have not been proven or formally adjudicated.
                   §   An event that is "on appeal" involves allegations that have been adjudicated but are currently
                       being appealed.
                   §   A "final" event has been concluded and its resolution is not subject to change.
             o  A final event generally has a disposition of adjudicated, settled or otherwise resolved.
                   §   An "adjudicated" matter includes a disposition by (1) a court of law in a criminal or civil matter,
                       or (2) an administrative panel in an action brought by a regulator that is contested by the party
                       charged with some alleged wrongdoing.
                   §   A "settled" matter generally involves an agreement by the parties to resolve the matter.
                       Please note that firms may choose to settle customer disputes or regulatory matters for
                       business or other reasons.
                   §   A "resolved" matter usually involves no payment to the customer and no finding of
                       wrongdoing on the part of the individual broker. Such matters generally involve customer
                       disputes.
     5. You may wish to contact the brokerage firm to obtain further information regarding any of the
        disclosure events contained in this BrokerCheck report.
 Regulatory - Final
 This type of disclosure event involves (1) a final, formal proceeding initiated by a regulatory authority (e.g., a state
 securities agency, self-regulatory organization, federal regulator such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
 foreign financial regulatory body) for a violation of investment-related rules or regulations; or (2) a revocation or
 suspension of the authority of a brokerage firm or its control affiliate to act as an attorney, accountant or federal
 contractor.

                                 THEIR ACCOUNT RECORDS, SPECIFICALLY NAME CHANGES, ADDRESS
                                 CHANGES, OR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE CHANGES (PROFILE UPDATE
                                 NOTICES). THE CUSTOMERS WHO CONTACTED THE FIRM ALL HELD
                                 ANNUITIES, MUTUAL FUNDS, OR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS
                                 (REITS) DIRECTLY WITH THE ISSUERS OF THE PRODUCTS (DIRECT
                                 APPLICATION ACCOUNTS), AND THE FIRM WAS NO LONGER THE BROKER-
                                 DEALER OF RECORD ON THOSE ACCOUNTS. AS A RESULT OF THE
                                 INQUIRIES FROM FORMER CUSTOMERS, THE FIRM ATTEMPTED TO
                                 SUPPRESS THE GENERATION AND MAILING OF PROFILE UPDATE NOTICES
                                 TO CUSTOMERS WITH DIRECT APPLICATION ACCOUNTS FOR WHICH THE
                                 FIRM WAS NO LONGER THE BROKER-DEALER OF RECORD. THOUGH THE
                                 SUPPRESSION WAS INTENDED TO ELIMINATE THE MAILING OF PROFILE
                                 UPDATE NOTICES TO FORMER FIRM CUSTOMERS, THE COMPUTER
                                 CODING USED BY THE FIRM ASSUMED THAT CUSTOMERS HAD CLOSED
                                 THEIR FIRM ACCOUNTS IF THERE WAS NO LINK BETWEEN THE
                                 CUSTOMERS' DIRECT APPLICATION ACCOUNTS AND THEIR FIRM
                                 PROFILES. THERE WERE SITUATIONS, HOWEVER, IN WHICH EXISTING
                                 FIRM CUSTOMERS HAD DIRECT APPLICATION ACCOUNTS THAT WERE NOT
                                 LINKED TO THEIR FIRM PROFILES. CONSEQUENTLY, FIRM CUSTOMERS
                                 WITH DIRECT APPLICATION ACCOUNTS NOT LINKED TO THEIR FIRM
                                 PROFILES DID NOT RECEIVE PROFILE UPDATE NOTICES. THE FINDINGS
                                 ALSO STATED THAT THE FIRM FAILED TO ESTABLISH ADEQUATE WRITTEN
                                 SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES (WSPS) REASONABLY DESIGNED TO
                                 ENSURE THE PROPER SUPERVISION OF THE CREATION AND
                                 MAINTENANCE OF ACCURATE ACCOUNT RECORDS. THE FIRM'S WSPS DID
                                 NOT CONTAIN ANY PROCESSES OR PROCEDURES TO TEST AND VERIFY
                                 WHETHER PROFILE UPDATE NOTICES WERE PROPERLY GENERATED AND
                                 MAILED TO CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT, THE FIRM FAILED TO DETECT THAT
                                 PROFILE UPDATE NOTICES WERE IMPROPERLY SUPPRESSED.
